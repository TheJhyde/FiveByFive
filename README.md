# FiveByFive
A tumblr and twitter bot which will post every single five by five square over the course of many hundreds of years. You can see it in action [on twitter](http://twitter.com/fivebyfivebot) and [on tumblr](http://fivebyfivebot.tumblr.com/).

Five by Five bot was made using the libraries for [RMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/RMagick/doc/index.html), [Twitter](https://rubygems.org/gems/twitter), and [Tumblr](https://rubygems.org/gems/tumblr). Many thanks to Vogon's [EveryColor](https://github.com/vogon/everycolor), which I took a lot of inspiration from.
